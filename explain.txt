Simple Project Explanation (For Everyone):
------------------------------------------
This project is a job portal website where people can post jobs and search for jobs online. You can create your own profile, upload your photo, and add your contact details. Companies can post job openings, and job seekers can browse and apply for jobs. Everything you see on the website is stored safely in a database, so your information is not lost. The website is easy to use and works on your computer or phone.

Technical Project Explanation
============================

- This is a simple job portal project built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend.
- The frontend uses React Router for navigation between pages.
- API fetching is done using the fetch API to communicate with the backend.
- All job and user data is stored in MongoDB, which supports JSON format and is accessed using Mongoose.
- The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful API routes for jobs, users, profiles, and file uploads.
- Multer is used for handling file uploads (e.g., user avatars).
- The project supports user registration, profile editing, job posting, and company listing.
- The UI is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive look.
- The backend exposes routes such as:
  - /api/jobs (GET, POST): Fetch and upload jobs
  - /api/companies (GET): Fetch unique company names
  - /api/profile (GET, PUT): Fetch and update user profile
  - /api/users (POST): Register new users
  - /api/upload/:username (POST): Upload user avatar
- The project is organized with clear separation between frontend (src/) and backend (server/src/).
- All data is exchanged in JSON format between frontend and backend.
- This project is suitable for learning full-stack development with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

(Like of maile simple React JS use gare xu. JSma use bhaxa React Router, fetching the API, store database in MongoDB supports JSON format. I have used Node.js for backend and there is route. Sabai info yo project ko.)
